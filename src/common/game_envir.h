How to find in which pak is located a given file?
- First of all, all file names are unique so you won't find a file named 'foo'
in two different pak files.
- Second, per-level files are located in level-related pak files. For example
files like 'LEVEL1.SHP', 'LEVEL1.INF' are located in 'L01.PAK'.
- Lastly, some general files like background ui, item icons are located in
general pak files like 'GENERAL.PAK' and 'STARTUP.PAK'.

So here's the heuristic when loading a file;
- If the file load request comes from a script - eg LoadGraphics then it should
be straightforward to deduce the PAK file from the file path. Example:
'LEVEL1.INF' is in LO1.PAK.

- If the file needs to be load from main code, either specify the PAK from which
to load the content, or load all pak files until the right file is found. This
last option is doable because all file names are unique, but it will be
slooooooooow.
