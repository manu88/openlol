# Lands of Lore CLI

## build
```bash
make
```

Might require to install some dependencies like SDL.

## game assets
You need to create a "data" folder in the root of the repo and copy all â€˜pak' files into it.

## usage
```bash
./lol -h
```

## how to "play" a level
Play is a very misleading term :) , right now you can move around in the mazes, with *some* graphics correctly displayed.

```bash
./lol game 1 1 #chapter 1 level 1 - a.k.a keep
```
